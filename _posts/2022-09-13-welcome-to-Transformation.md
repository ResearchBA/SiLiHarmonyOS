The era of digitization and intelligence is coming. 

In order to form a strong core competency, you should undertake cognitive transformation and form your own infrastructure.

`Tyo` (Transformation your own) and `Iyo` (Infrastructure your own) are your really effective minds and tools.

You need to make changes spontaneously, develop specific perceptions, and master the tools available.

## Transformation your own

A full understanding of digitization and intelligence is a milestone on your transformation journey. Correct interpretation of them is also an important task of this column.

## Infrastructure your own

Your infrastructure should include: product, technology, business and strategy. This column will lead you on the right path and help you build your own infrastructure.
